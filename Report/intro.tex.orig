Hutter has proven that AIXI model produces better result than any other existing learning algorithm. The Bayesian Mixture model will converge to the unknown true model.  However, Kolmogorov complexity is incomputable. Using Context Tree Weighting and Monte Carlo sampling as approximation, we can build a universal reinforcement learning agent based on approximation of AIXI.

Group 3 has implemented the reinforcement agent that can learn from various encoded environments.

This assignment is closely related to Veness's paper. We are building a reinforcement learning agent using UCT algorithm, MC sampling, AIXI, and universal Bayesian mixture. The agent then learns to play Pacman, Tic-Tac-Toe, Biased Rock-Paper-Scissor, Extended Tiger, and Cheese Maze.

Chapter~\ref{cha:background} mainly deals with the theoretical findings of Vanness' paper, and briefly touches on Monte Carlo sampling, UTC algorithm, context tree weighting [V+11], and how our agent combines these, as required by the assignment.
